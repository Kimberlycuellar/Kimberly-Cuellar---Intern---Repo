"Reflection Ciber Security"
1. What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I use strong passwords and avoid suspicious links.
I can improve by using a password manager and enabling two-factor authentication on all my accounts.
2. How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
I can do this by being aware every day, checking before clicking or accepting cookies within web pages, blocking my devices automatically.
3. What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- Use strong passwords
- Enable 2FA on all accounts
- Use a password manager
- Not sharing my data
4. What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?  
I would change my password, activate or review the 2FA, check recent activity and report if there is a more serious problem
